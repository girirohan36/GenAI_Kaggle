ðŸª™ **Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering**  
I explored the evolution of large language models (LLMs), from transformers to cutting-edge techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. I also trained in the art of prompt engineering to enhance interactions with LLMs for optimal outcomes.  

ðŸª™ **Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases**  
I dived deep into the concept of embeddings and vector databases, learning about embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and their real-world applications with LLMs. I also analyzed the trade-offs involved in leveraging these tools effectively.  

ðŸª™ **Day 3: Generative AI Agents**  
I learned to build sophisticated AI agents by breaking down their core components and understanding the iterative development process needed to refine them.  

ðŸª™ **Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs**  
I explored the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM. Hearing directly from the researchers who developed them offered unique insights into their design and use cases.  

ðŸª™ **Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI**  
I discovered how to adapt MLOps practices specifically for Generative AI. Using tools like Vertex AI, I gained hands-on experience with foundational models and generative AI applications, focusing on efficiency and scalability.
